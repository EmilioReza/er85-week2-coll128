I completed lessons 1.1 to 1.5

Things I found surprising:
    Many basic Google Docs editing options were in vim (undo/redo, find/replace, cut/copy/paste, etc.)
    When undo-ing, it tells you how long ago the change was, like a full revision history
    Despite the focus of vim seeming to be to minimize the distance your fingers move (like putting the up/down/left/right all in the home row), the button for switching modes is far away (ESC).

It took me a while to get familiar to use h/j/k/l to move the cursor around instead of arrow keys. I kept finding myself wanting to press a key in the bottom row to move down.
